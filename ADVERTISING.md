The character limit for your company name and byline is **90 characters**, including spaces, in order to keep the byline to a single line.

More than half of users have English set as their default language, with most in the US. ChatGPT Prompt Genius is English-first and does not have any translation (yet), meaning your audience, even outside the US, likely understands English.

We make no guarantees on possible results.
