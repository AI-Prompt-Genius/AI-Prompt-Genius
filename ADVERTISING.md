The character limit for your company name and byline is **90 characters**, including spaces, in order to keep the byline to a single line.

### Reach

ChatGPT Prompt Genius has over 50,000 weekly active users, and has shown consistent growth. Reach this AI conscious market right on ChatGPT. 

More than half of users have English set as their default language, with most in the US. ChatGPT Prompt Genius is English-first and does not have any translation (yet), meaning your audience, even outside the US, likely understands English.

We make no guarantees on possible results.

Payment will be made through a Stripe payment link and is expected to be paid upfront.
