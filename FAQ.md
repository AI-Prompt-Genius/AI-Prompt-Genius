### ChatGPT Prompt Genius FAQ

**Why does this extension require reddit permissions?**

The only permission we require is for our own subreddit, r/ChatGPTPromptGenius, and this is only to help format when you submit prompts to our subreddit. We also insert a button to allow you to quickly import other peopleâ€™s prompts. We do not run any scripts on any other subreddit, and we do not collect any data from reddit. If you are still wary about this permission, you can disable the access at chrome://extensions/?id=jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo > Site access > reddit.com.

**What do you do with my data?**

We understand that your data is important to you, and we want to assure you that it is completely under your control. All of your data is stored locally on your device, and we do not claim any ownership over it. Additionally, we do not have access to your data (we do not have servers), as it is stored solely on your device's local storage. If you choose to share a chat, it will be uploaded to a ShareGPT server, but you will still retain the rights to your data. You can export your data at any time in its raw JSON format, and we are also working on adding more export formats for your convenience.

**I found a bug!**

We're sorry to hear that you've encountered a bug. If you could please raise an issue on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/benf2004/ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius/issues), we'll work on resolving the problem as soon as possible. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also open a pull request to fix the bug yourself and be the change you want to see in the world!

**I have a feature idea!**

We're always looking for ways to improve our extension, and we would love to hear your ideas. Please use the discussions on our GitHub repository https://github.com/benf2004/ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius/discussions to share your thoughts.

**Who is "we"?**

This project is open-source and we encourage you to read the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/benf2004/ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius. If you see anything that needs improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

**Can I delete something I've shared via link?**

Unfortunately, we are using the public servers from ShareGPT to host your shared services. We have no way of accessing that data. We suggest you should not share any sensitive information.

**Is there any other data that is shared?**

Unless you explicitly share that data using the "share link" button, no data leaves your device. It is all stored in local storage, even exports to pdf/png/md.
