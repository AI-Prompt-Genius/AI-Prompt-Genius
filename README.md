# ChatGPT-History 
<em>Written by ChatGPT, of course</em>

Welcome to ChatGPT History, a Chrome extension that allows you to save your ChatGPT conversation history. With this extension, you can easily review your past conversations and refer to them at a later time.

To use the extension, simply open ChatGPT and start chatting as you normally would. The extension will automatically save your conversation history in your Chrome browser. You can access your saved history by clicking on the extension icon in the top right corner of your browser.

In the extension's settings, you can choose to clear your saved history or export it as a text file for easy sharing or backup. <em>Still need to implement</em>

We hope you find ChatGPT History Saver useful and enjoy using it to save and review your ChatGPT conversations. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to make a pull request. Thank you for using ChatGPT History!

## TODO
If you're looking to help out, you could add a few useful features to our platform:
- Search feature to filter threads
- Export individual threads to pdf, csv, txt, or doc formats
- Export all threads to XLS/Gsheets
- Bookmark threads for easy access later
- Improvements to the styling on the "All Threads" page
- Ability to delete threads from history

These enhancements would make the platform even more user-friendly and useful for our users. Thank you for considering contributing to the project!
