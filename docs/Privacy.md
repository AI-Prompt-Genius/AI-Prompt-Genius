### ChatGPT Prompt Genius FAQ & Privacy Policy

**What do you do with my data?**

We understand that your data is important to you, and we want to assure you that it is completely under your control. All of your data is stored locally on your device, and we do not claim any ownership over it. Additionally, we do not have access to your data (we do not have servers), as it is stored solely on your device's local storage. If you choose to share a chat, it will be uploaded to a ShareGPT server, but you will still retain the rights to your data. You can export your data at any time in its raw JSON format, and we are also working on adding more export formats for your convenience.

**What do you do if I link my prompts to Google Sheets?**
Your data stays secure with you. We do not have any access to the data you sync to Google Sheets. We cannot view any of your prompts shared on Google Drive. You can revoke access to ChatGPT Prompt Genius by clicking the "Unlink Sheet" button or in https://myaccount.google.com/permissions. 

**I found a bug!**

We're sorry to hear that you've encountered a bug. If you could please raise an issue on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/benf2004/ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius/issues), we'll work on resolving the problem as soon as possible.

**Who is "we"?**

This project is open-source and we encourage you to read the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/benf2004/ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius. If you see anything that needs improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

**Can I delete something I've shared via link?**

Unfortunately, we are using the public servers from ShareGPT to host your shared services. We have no way of accessing that data. We suggest you should not share any sensitive information.

**Is there any other data that is shared?**

Unless you explicitly share that data using the "share link" button, no data leaves your device. It is all stored in local storage, even exports to pdf/png/md. 

**What if I click on an advertisement?**
If you click on an advertisement, you will be subject to that website's privacy policy.
