## Advertising Space

Advertising on AI Prompt Genius is simple and non-intrusive, yet effective. 

We offer two choices of advertising, one on this website, and one on the main extension.

### Main Advertising Slot - In Extension 
We offer a single tagline at the top of the page above the user's prompt templates, with a link to your product page. 

Here's an example:

![[addemo.png]]

The character limit for your product name and tagline is **90 characters**, including spaces, in order to keep the advertisement to a single line.

Users will also see your ad in the prompt creator page with the same nonintrusive tagline.

*Additionally, when a user uninstalls the extension, they will be taken to your page.*

### Reach 

AI Prompt Genius is a growing platform with over 170,000 weekly active users and 90,000 daily active users. Our user base is primarily English-speaking. We also have a sizeable Chinese-speaking population. The largest portion of our users are located in the United States. 

We are happy to provide more detailed, anonymized demographics upon request (as provided by the Chrome Web Store). 

From past campaigns, you can expect, on average, **500 clicks/day** for your ad (on the main slot). 

### Pricing - Main slot

Our current rates are:

- $100/day
- $600/week (7 consecutive days)
- Longer campaigns may qualify for further discounts

Payment is expected to be made upfront through a secure Stripe payment link. We do not offer refunds for canceled advertisements.

If you decide to run a week-long campaign, you may have multiple different versions (copies) of ads for the same product, up to one for each day. 

Ads are reserved on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please see the calendar below for which dates are available. **We have open slots starting July 16**.

We understand that every business has unique needs and goals, and we are happy to work with you to create a customized advertising plan that meets your needs. If you have any questions about our pricing or advertising opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at **[aipromptgenius@gmail.com](mailto:aipromptgenius@gmail.com)**.

## Other advertising opportunities 
### This website

This website serves as a tutorial page. At the bottom of each page on this website, there is a spot for a banner image advertisement. The dimensions for this advertisement should be 650 x 100 pixels. 

Notably, every time a user installs the extension, the [[00 - Welcome|welcome page]] appears, so your advertisement can expect to reach at least 1000 people per day.

Here is an example:
![[adHere.jpg]]

Pricing for this ad is somewhat cheaper since less people see it on average, though it does allow for images. 

### **Pricing - This website**
We offer simple and affordable advertising rates. Our current rates are:

- $25/day
- $125/week (7 consecutive days)

Unlike for the main slot, these rates are the nonnegotiable best price.

Payment is expected to be made upfront through a secure Stripe payment link. We do not offer refunds for canceled advertisements.

If you decide to run a week-long campaign, you may have multiple different versions  (copies) of ads for the same product, up to one for each day. 

Ads are reserved on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please see the calendar below for which dates are available.
